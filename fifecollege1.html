<h1>My Fife College</h1>
<p>Fife College is a really good path way after school and after whatever
    you plan on doing after its a great way to learn
    just what you want to learn and at your best intrests at heart
    also another good thing about fife college is that the people
    that work there are very helpful and very freindly so
    its easy to get on with the work at hand and put your 
    maximum effort into it aswell.</p>
    
<h1> My Expereince</h1>
<p> During my first time ever going to college
    i felt very nervous but as time went on through the 
    year i become to be more confident and was able to 
    work at nearly my full potential. About the staff at 
    Fife College they are very nice and outspoken about what
    there is too do at hand and what work has to be done
    but they are nice baout it in every way also they are very kind.
    My only cristisisum is they through so much work at you 
    which is hard to deal with and they expect evbraything on time with this work
    load throughout ther year.</p>
