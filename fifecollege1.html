<h1>My Fife College</h1>
    
    
<p1> Fife College is a really good path way after school and after whatever
    you plan on doing after its a great way to learn
    just what you want to learn and at your best intrests at heart
    also another good thing about fife college is that the people
    that work there are very helpful and very freindly so
    its easy to get on with the work at hand and put your 
    maximum effort into it aswell.</p1>
    
    
    
<h1> My Expereince</h1>
    
    
<p1> During my first time ever going to college
    i felt very nervous but as time went on through the 
    year i become to be more confident and was able to 
    work at nearly my full potential. About the staff at 
    Fife College they are very nice and outspoken about what
    there is too do at hand and what work has to be done
    but they are nice baout it in every way also they are very kind.
    My only cristisisum is they through so much work at you 
    which is hard to deal with and they expect evbraything on time with this work
    load throughout ther year.</p1>
    
    
    
<h1>My Current Course</h1>
    
    
<p1>My current course at Fife College is Games and Developmet
    HND and its my 2nd year of college last year i did Level 6
    and that was hard but this course is a bigger step up in work
    quality annd demands. You learn alot throughout the year 
    mostly about games and we also learn about websites aswell
    so if i was to recommend it to other people i would very
    enjoyable course to do and very hard but fun aswell terachers are
    very fun too which makes it alot easier. My only critisise is the
    load of work we get given at one time other than that great!!!!</p1>
    
<h1> What I Plan TO Do Next</h1>
    
<p1> With Me Just half Way through this year of my college course i plan to do a HNC or go to 
    University it just depends on my situation in the coming year and what also my
    life is like at the time of when i make my decision.</p1>
