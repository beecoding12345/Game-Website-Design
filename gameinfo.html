<h1>Game Controls</h1>

<p1>The game controls in this game that i am making is going
    to be very simple but affective and is also easy to use for most people to use
    when playing the game cause you just need to hold your hands at each
    end of the tablet that we are going to use the game on. Once you have done
    that then to play the game you have to tilt the tablet from side to side
    right for making the bouncing slider go right and left for the
    bouncing slider to go left. Which makes it easy to understand how to 
    play the game and also for the controls to be easy to use.</p1>
